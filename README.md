# Get-triangle-angles-with-sides
Calculated the angles of triangle with given sides by the user.

From LAw of cosine we made a function and implemented law of cosine in python form

Then we made another function and calculated the three angles which are alpha, beta, gamma.

In the last we compared the angles with the conditions of acute, obtuse, right and of 'no triangle'.
